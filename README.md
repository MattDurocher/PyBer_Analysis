# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Our job today was to help V. Isualize with tracking data for the ride share company known as PyBer. PyBer wanted to track their total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. We broke this data up in three categories for rural, suburban, and urban cities. This data was then visualized in a data frame. Following this, we created a line graph showing the total fare value per week for each city type. 
## Results
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
When looking at the first data frame chart, we can see something interesting (this is based off of the assumption that population increases from rural to suburban to urban). As the population increases, the total amount of demanded rides, available drivers, and total fares all incrase. However, as population increases, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver decreases. From this information, it is interesting to point out that PyBer must pay their driver's more money in rural areas than they do in suburban areas. This most likely comes from supply and demand; in the larger cities, there are both more people willing to drive and more people demanding rides but in rural settings, the demand for rides outweighs the amount of available drivers which forced the company to increase wages to attract more drivers.

When looking at our bar chart, it is interesting to notice the diference in trends. Obviously the fares are different, but we already established that. What is really interesting is to notice that each city type doesn't follow the same pattern as the other two. Going back to my previous point about demand, this shows that the demand flucuates at different rates per city type in given periods.

## Summary
