# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Our job today was to help V. Isualize with tracking data for the ride share company known as PyBer. PyBer wanted to track their total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. We broke this data up in three categories for rural, suburban, and urban cities. This data was then visualized in a data frame. Following this, we created a line graph showing the total fare value per week for each city type. 
## Results
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
