# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Our job today was to help V. Isualize with tracking data for the rideshare company known as PyBer. PyBer wanted to track their total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and the average fare per driver. We broke this data up in three categories for rural, suburban, and urban cities. This data was then visualized in a data frame. Following this, we created a line graph showing the total fare value per week for each city type. 
## Results
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
When looking at the first data frame chart, we can see something interesting (this is based on the assumption that population increases from rural to suburban to urban). As the population increases, the total amount of demanded rides, available drivers, and total fares all increase. However, as population increases, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver decreases. From this information, it is interesting to point out that PyBer must pay their driver's more money in rural areas than they do in suburban areas. This most likely comes from supply and demand; in the larger cities, there are both more people willing to drive and more people demanding rides but in rural settings, the demand for rides outweighs the amount of available drivers which forces the company to increase wages to attract more drivers.

When looking at our bar chart, it is interesting to notice the difference in trends. Obviously the fares are different, but we already established that. What is really interesting is to notice that each city type doesn't follow the same pattern as the other two. Going back to my previous point about demand, this shows that the demand fluctuates at different rates per city type in given periods.

## Summary
### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among city types.
1. My big point from earlier was supply and demand, figuring out a way to get more money in the pockets of urban drivers while also figuring out a way to make fares cheaper for rural passengers would be essential. The system is laid out as such that it is really favorable to be a rural driver or an urban passenger but, this isn't fair for everyone involved. Urban drivers will eventually be burnt out without proper pay and Rural passengers will eventually turn to another service that is more cost effective.
2. My second recommendation would be pushing urban drivers out towards the suburbs. There are nearly 5x as many drivers in the urban markets compared to drivers in the suburban markets. While you could do the same for suburban to rural, you could easily move drivers from urban to suburban. There are 800 more drivers than riders in the urban market so while it would be unfair to suburban drivers to throw 800 more drivers in their market, it would be really easy for them to match the demand getting more money in the pockets of drivers and less of a wait time for passengers.
3. Fares for every city type took a sizable dip during the last week of February, my final recommendation would be for PyBer to speak to users and drivers about this so that they can address these issues in the future. Maybe rates were too high or, maybe there weren't enough drivers on the road. Whatever the problem was, it is interesting to see every city type take a hit during this time period.
